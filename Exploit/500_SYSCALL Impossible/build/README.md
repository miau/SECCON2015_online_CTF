#How to setup production environment
Run the following commands.
* build/scripts/create-production-image.sh
    * Build the docker image for a production environment, named "localhost/chari/pinhole:production".
* build/scripts/run-production.sh
    * Run vulnserver w/ xinetd in a new container based on "localhost/chari/pinhole:production".

#How to build packages for production
* build/scripts/create-development-image.sh
    * Build the docker image for a development environment, named "localhost/chari/pinhole:development".
* build/scripts/run-development.sh
    * Run bash in a new container of "localhost/chari/pinhole:development".
    * In the new container, you can build production packages(pinhole-root.tgz and pinhole\_conf) by executing /opt/make-all.sh. The files will be output to /opt/production-files/, which is connected to build/production-files/ in the host filesystem.
    * To deploy the new production packages, you have to rebuild a production environment.
